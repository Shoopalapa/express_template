# Express template with handlebars, API, and Swagger

### About
This program is here for anyone to download and begin developing without starting from scratch.  Most of the programs I use involve some type of html documentation that should dynamically change, store information in a DB, use an API, and display the endpoints somewhere.  This is why I have used express with handlebars and swagger for a UI.  

### What 

### Install
```npm install``` - install the dependancies
Set up a sql server with a db called ```website_db```

### Testing
```npm test``` - start the app with nodemon (restarts on file changes)

### Run
```npm start``` - starts app
